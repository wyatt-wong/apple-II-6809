# Apple II 6809 Board
The 6809 Board for Apple II was designed by Alex Freed in year 2012. It is a clone of the Stellation Two "Mill" card but include memory remapping for OS9 using Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD) on a Generic Array Logic (GAL), which replace the original daughterboard for Stellation Two "Mill" card. The memory remapping also minimize the chip counts to make the board smaller.
